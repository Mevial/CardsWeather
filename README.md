# This project is about the weather.

## We can enter any city in the world, and we will receive a card with a detailed description. It is possible to update data every 5 seconds, delete cards, update cards pointwise.

## It is also possible to reload the application and your saved cards will remain in local storage.

## There are some features that have not yet been implemented, but are in the process of development:

### 1) Drop-down list for input (with the ability to select a City) and a subsequent request.
